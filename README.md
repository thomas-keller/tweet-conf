# tweet-conf
Some simple R scripts to collect and visualize twitter happenings around a conference hashtag. Currently the "organization," such as it is, mainly lies in the one larger script gettweets_ex.R that has all the code to make the figures that I talk about in this [blog post](http://thomas-keller.github.io/articles/I-analyzed-evolution-2016-twitter-and-you-can-too-for-other-conferences/). There are also a couple short scripts that demonstrates how to pull down tweets with twitteR or streamR. TwitteR should be much more practicle for most conference scale events, unless they are approaching 10's of thousands, then you might need to go to streamR.

The script covers making a wordcloud, sentiment analysis of a conference through time, and making a network graph of the top twitter users. There's lots of room for improvement in these analyses, so let me know if there's something I should be doing better!
